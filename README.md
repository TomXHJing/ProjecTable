# ProjecTable

**Welcome to ProjecTable**, a personal endeavor into the world of 3D web graphics. Here, you'll embark on a unique journey through a meticulously crafted virtual desk space. Each item, from a tiny knick-knack to the central computer, represents a part of my professional narrative. Be it a skill, a side project, a major endeavor, or a memorable journey, every object has a tale to tell.

## Core Features

- **Interactive 3D Desk Experience**: Built using Three.js, the desk is more than just a static visual. Rotate it, zoom in, zoom out, or simply admire it from different angles.
  
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Each object is clickable. A click either unveils a detailed view or redirects you to an external link, diving deeper into the backstory of the object in question.
  
- **Responsive and Fluid**: Designed with a mobile-first approach, ProjecTable ensures a smooth experience across devices. Whether you're viewing it on a widescreen monitor, a laptop, a tablet, or a mobile phone, the experience remains consistent and engaging.

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js**: For 3D rendering and creating the interactive desk environment.
  
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: The backbone of the web project, ensuring structure, styling, and interactivity.
  
- **Node.js (Potential)**: In case there's a backend in the future, Node.js is the intended platform.

## Setup and Installation

*Currently under development.* Detailed steps for local setup and installation will be provided soon.

## Solo Project Disclaimer

This project is a personal initiative, a canvas for my creativity and technical prowess. While I'm enthusiastic about collaborations in other endeavors, ProjecTable is a solo journey, an intimate portrayal of my professional narrative.
